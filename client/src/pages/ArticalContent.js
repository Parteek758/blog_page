             "The Atal Setu Bridge project is the first cable-stayed bridge procured under a design-build contract in India by the Border Roads Organization of the Ministry of Defence. The bridge traverses the River Ravi and connects the states of Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir, creating a critical link for the communities on either side of the river and emergency response access to the Kashmir Valley.",
             `McElhanney was responsible for the detailed design, construction engineering, and site support. Developing a cost-effective design suited to the difficult site conditions that could be built smartly were the main goals.
             As the bridge is in a high seismic zone with strong winds of 140 km/h, McElhanney’s team developed design features to minimize construction materials, improve constructability, enhance aerodynamic stability, and reduce seismic response.`,
             `For high seismic regions, diamond-shaped towers are favorable but difficult to build due to the inclined legs. McElhanney’s team developed modified diamond-shaped towers, which meant bringing the tower legs above deck together to a common point just above the traffic clearance envelope to merge into a single vertical cantilever leg. This vertical leg is simpler and faster to build than two inclined legs and it permitted superstructure cantilevering concurrently with tower construction.`,
             `By connecting the cables to the central vertical leg, a rigid cables-deck triangle resulted that provided aerodynamic stability against twisting effects. With the tower and cable configuration aiding in the wind stability, the main span could then be engineered as a lightweight edge girder system, easier to fabricate and erect than stiffer box shapes typically used on such bridges.
             Most modern cable-stayed bridges have superstructures made entirely of either composite steel or concrete. Taking advantage of the shallow natural terrain on either side of the river, the team could use a combination of cast-in-place concrete for the side spans and lightweight composite steel in the main span, which provided erection advantages and assisted in eliminating uplift at the abutments.
             Three sets of intermediate pier props in the side spans helped stiffen the system and reduce demands from wind and live load by over 50%.`

             `Jot Pass stands at a height of 2880 meters above the sea level. One wise man once said that without crossing over the Jot Pass you never get to know what reaching Chamba means. Jot Pass overlooks the Chuwadi Valley and it is 23 kilometers away from the top of the Pass. Jot is a hidden treasure in Himachal Pradesh. If you want some place away from hassle of Shimla and Manali, Jot is the place to be.`,
             `Jot is one of the highest altitude tourist destinations in Chamba and is located on the Pathankot-Nurpur-Chowari-Chamba stretch. During the winter months, it remains covered in thick snow and is closed for vehicles. The route re-opens in the summers but being a less commercialized place, it does not get crowded with tourists. It a primeval stretch, perfect for those who love exploring the unexplored.`,
             `Jot is well-known for trekking and hiking.`

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).",
